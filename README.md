# MachineLearning-dota

This is the machine learning program used in my assignment. It uses sklearn package which you need to install first if you want to test it out. There might be some other packages I didn't mention here but it's not too much of a hassle to look into the program code to see what's needed (it's what, 20 lines?)

The link to the report which describes the purpose is here http://users.jyu.fi/~jupejunt/TIES1000/ties1000_assignment_report_Jukka_Juntti.pdf
